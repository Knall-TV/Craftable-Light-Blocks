A simple Datapack that adds a crafting recipe to your game which allows you to craft Light Blocks with the light power of 15 (possible in Survival). This datapack already includes a default crafting recipe but you could also change it by yourself by using online generators like this one: [https://crafting.thedestruc7i0n.ca/](https://crafting.thedestruc7i0n.ca/)

When you have created your json file you can put the content of that generated file into the file _light.json_, which you can find inside the **craftable-light-blocks** datapack folder under the path: **\data\light-blocks\recipe\light.json**

About the default crafting recipe: To craft a Lightblock you only need one torch and 6 not stained glass panes and follow the scheme in the picture:

The [Source Code](https://github.com/Knall-TV/Craftable-Light-Blocks/) is only available for the newest version of Minecraft that is included in the version range of this datapack. - There is also only the newest datapack version available. (In this case the datapack version v.2.1 for Minecraft version 1.21.4)

Have fun with this Datapack! :)
