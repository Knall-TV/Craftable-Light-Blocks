# Craftable Light Blocks
A simple Datapack that adds a crafting recipe to your game with wich you can craft Light Blocks with the light power of 15 (possible in Survival). This datapack already includes a default crafting recipe but you could also change it by yourself by using online generators like this one: [https://crafting.thedestruc7i0n.ca/](https://crafting.thedestruc7i0n.ca/)

When you have created your json file you can put the content of that generated file into the file _light.json_, which you can find inside the **craftable-light-blocks** datapack folder under the path: **data\light-blocks\recipe\light.json**

The default crafting recipe: To craft a Lightblock you only need one torch and 6 not stained glass panes and follow the scheme in the picture:
